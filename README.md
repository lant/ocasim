# Game of the Goose small simulator. 

The other day I was playing the [Game of the Goose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_the_Goose) with my kids and I tried to see if there was a way to win the game with just one turn. Well, of course it is. 

It's easy to see it in the board, but I thought it would be just funnier to implement a small brute force program to do the moves for me. Here it is. 

Mind that this is late night coding, and just for fun. 

## Result 

If you are lucky enough to get 5, 6, 3 and 6 you win. And your kids will get outraged.
